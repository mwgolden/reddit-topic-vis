It was part of a \"Truth\" he posted claiming the Obama's helped Biden steal the 2020 election shit you not cause directly after he ranted about them and Dominion voting machines ... this is who we selected to run the USA. The rest of the world is watching who we selected. I mean I voted for Kamala so the owness is less on me ... but this is all our collective failures. We still have 3 more years too. Biden's biggest actual scandal was a $3K payment for a car and a laptop Republicans refused to do a public trial over because they felt like showing \"evidence\" would have broken their narrative over lying about evidence. But that's like walking to breakfast on a Tuesday for Trump.",

You don\u2019t reach that point without racism becoming normalized in the party and without the public letting it slide/failing to clock it.\n\nNow, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible to change it, but it\u2019s definitely going to take time, and the ball is largely going to be in Republicans\u2019 court. Because of that, I\u2019m more focused on efforts of getting the centrists, the moderates, and the enlightened \u201cnon-wokes\u201d to understand that those of us they were writing off as extreme fearmongers weren\u2019t being hyperbolic when we called the Republican Party racist as a collective. We weren\u2019t grasping at straws overall. We saw the signs, and some of us live among/have lived among Republicans. We knew what the fuck we were talking about.\n\nIn some cases, the groups of people I\u2019m talking about reaching couldn\u2019t clock it because they were also guilty of some of the same more subtle shit the Republican Party has been guilty of for frankly decades. As they often pointed out in defending Republicans over the years, racism isn\u2019t limited to just Republicans.\u00a0\nPart of the problem is that many people\u2019s bar for determining if something is racist is at the most obvious of levels\u2014almost quite literally, someone has to be caught saying \u201cI think your entire race of people are inferior to my race.\u201d I\u2019m sure there will be people claiming that this video of Barack and Michelle as gorillas isn\u2019t racist, even though this is one of the more obvious racist tropes with regard to black people to the point where it shouldn\u2019t be thought of as a dog whistle.\n\nIf anyone reading this hasn\u2019t learned or been taught this, it\u2019s a longstanding racist trope to compare black people to various primates. If you don\u2019t believe me, look it up, and I\u2019d encourage you to start looking up various racist tropes and their histories. I get that if you were never taught this, didn\u2019t grow up around a lot of black people who might\u2019ve been able to teach you this, and didn\u2019t grow up when this was more collectively understood, you may not know this is a thing. Consider this someone telling you it\u2019s a thing and that it\u2019s still a thing, so you can now no longer claim no one told you.\n\nSomeone the age of Trump\u2019s age and the age of the people in his inner circle know this. Trust me; they aren\u2019t ignorant toward this, especially with how much they\u2019ve toyed with literal Nazi allusions.",

Shitty job but also censoring names of suspected co conspirators which is against the law.\n\n+ Shitty health, no exercise, McDonald's diet, Adderall fueled. He's barely clinging on because some of the world's best doctors treat US presidents. The White House pharmacy will prescribe anything too, plenty of reporting about that.\n\nIt's going to feel unceremonious but the celebrations will make up for that. Then the attacks on celebrations will kill the joy. Then Vance urges everyone to chill tf out. Tries to inherit MAGA, appease them but also get rid of Stephen Miller and most insane ICE activities (still brutal mass deportations btw). But MGT also trying to inherit MAGA, so we'll see.\n\nNext week? Black history month 'gift'? Giving us fascism for lent? Spring renewal? It'll fall under something soon. My worry is people celebrate but don't actually get involved in fighting to fix the system and we're basically like a worse 2021-2024 again, then Dems winning 2026 House but losing 2028 because their campaigns are extremely outdated, top down, nepotistic, egotistical personalities incapable of accepting constructive criticism, controlling, acting good for camera/'reporting' numbers but doing shitty jobs, etc.",

That's why it's so important to use evidence to decide what to believe, because a schizophrenic with evidence is more trustworthy than a non-schizophrenic with no evidence; evidence is the great equalizer that lets you be sure what is true regardless of the source (assuming the evidence itself is trustworthy). I've talked to people whom legitimately believe they are god's envoy on Earth or that aliens can speak to them through the voices in their head; clearly, some seriously substantive proof is needed to substantiate such outrageous claims. (I myself have hallucinated things like fake radio traffic from non-existent police officers surveilling me for crimes that never happened. At the time I felt it was real but thankfully on medication I know the difference.) \n\nIf you take sincerity as a marker of truth then you are going to get tricked into believing things which are false just because the person who told you the false information sincerely believes it despite it being false (due to psychosis, misinformation, or just plain being wrong). Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence; you shouldn't lose your sense of skepticism just because you want to believe something.",

The Christian persecutions that happened during his time are factual, but have very much been exaggerated. They were most likely very localized, and the city of Rome had a very small number of Christians at that time to begin with, so executing thousands would have been very difficult simply by demography alone.\n\nHe was in fact so popular, that decades after his death rumors about him resurrecting/being reborn (Nero Redivivus) to save the common folk were circling, especially in the eastern Part of the empire. This is very likely the reference of the \"beast rising from the pit\" in Revelation. His rumoured resurrection, was obviously seen as a threat to the Jesus resurrection story, and  this combined with his anti-Christian actions made him a very popular target to demonize him over the centuries.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to defend Trump (or Nero for a fact) \u2014 but Nero is kind of a bad example.

I can't find that post. \n\nUnless someone can link me the original truth social post from the 5th of Feb that is featured in the video, I can see how conservatives would spin it. \n\nTo be clear: Trump shouldn't be posting his bullshit stolen election claims and if he does, he should have the attention span and diligence (of which he clearly has neither) to watch it all the way through and catch the undefendably racist clip.\n\nEdit: FUCK MAN that crazy motherfucker posts way too much. So after going through 50 fucking posts I can confirm that the longer video (from the morning of the 6th) I linked to containing the Obama clip inserted near the end is up on his truth social. He posts SO MUCH I wouldn't be surprised he missed it. I didn't find the isolated 2 second Obama clip featured in the YouTube video supposedly posted on his truth social the previous evening (the 5th) this whole is based on though.\n\nIn conclusion, this thread is based on a lie. He didn't post the Obama clip in isolation. He did however post a stolen election conspiracy clip containing the Obama clip at the end that he probably didn't watch all the way through because he's a moron and posts 50 times a day. \n\n\nAgain, he is a racist bigoted evil piece of shit but he still has enough wherewithal to stop short of saying the N word out loud. He's close, but not yet.",
